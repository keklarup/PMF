    "The FB webpage showing the full list of members from each FB group was manually saved to the local machine. BeautifulSoup was then used to parse the html. A bit of exploritory data analysis revealed each FB member's name could eventually be found in the recently joined section and with a particular class label. That information was used to scrape the names from each FB group, and counts of members of each group and overlaps between the groups could be made. These counts were slightly smaller than FB claimed. Finally, the Venn Diagram was made by an online tool: \n",
