    "When PMF finalists access the Talent Management System (TMS), they eventually reach a webpage with a table of every currently open position. Each row doubles as a javascript button, which when clicked brings the finalist to a page with the full description of that particular job.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a web browsers 'inspect element' function, you can quickly see a pattern in those buttons. Each is uniquely named after the opportunity number (eg 217 for posting PMF-2017-0217). Because of that pattern, a webscraper can easily be written to 'click' each button in turn. Once a button is clicked, the HTML from the page with the detailed description may then be scraped for local storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has 2 basic parts. The first part uses the webscraper Selenium to gather PMF position information for local storage. The script is not purely automated. When Selenium initially opens the url, the user must log into the TMS, navigate to the page with the table listing every opportunity, and set the page to display all available jobs. Additionally, a table of the available jobs to be saved as an excel file before running the scraping portion of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "During scraping the HTMl content of each individual job posting is saved in a Pandas dataframe. Afterwards, some clunky code pulls out useful bits of information (job title, location, closing date, etc) into different columns in the dataframe before saving the dataframe as a CSV file locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2nd part of this notebook opens that locally saved CSV file and does some additional processing. Most importantly, it breaks up each posting by locations. For example, if an opportunity has 3 available positions in DC and 1 available position in CO, this section of the script breaks those into 2 different rows. A bit of additional code does a boolean test for the possible starting grade level."
